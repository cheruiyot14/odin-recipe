# odin-recipe
Finaly I can say I made that bold step.

This recipe project consists of one of my girlfriend's favourite dish (Githeri) and actually it was the first that came into mind I just realize now that i also have my favourite. 
It is an African dish that originated from central Kenya.

I have been able to display the skills i have learnt by creating 3 recipes on my own. I feel proud of myself and i thank the entire Odin community for the suppport.

I have mastered the following;
Creating a boilerplate from scratch
cloning from github repository
staging and committing or simply taking snapshots
Writting down a few commands
