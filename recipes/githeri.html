        <h2>What is Githeri?</h2>
        <p>
            The name Githeri simply means or refers to <em>Succotash</em> in English. Unlike Succotash, 
            it does not include lima beans and uses other types such as Red Kidney, Pinto, or Adzuki beans.
            Githeri, also known as <strong>mutheri</strong> or <strong>muthere</strong>, is a traditional one-pot meal comprising 
            boiled corn (or maize) and beans, that originated in Central Kenya. It was referred 
            to as the traditional dish of the Kikuyu people in Central Kenya but has since seen 
            its popularity spread to other parts of the country due to its tasty, nutritious, 
            and affordable nature. It is also consumed in other parts of Africa and goes by several 
            names (<b>Adalu</b> in Nigeria, and <b>corn chaff</b> in Cameroon).<i>You can make it from scratch or use 
            already-boiled canned or frozen corn and beans, for convenience.</i>
